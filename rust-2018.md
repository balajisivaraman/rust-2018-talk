## The Edition System

- Rust operates on a six-week cycle, unlike
other languages. Changes keep coming in
thick and fast.
- For example,
[1.26](https://github.com/Aaronepower/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1260-2018-05-10)
was one of the major releases in Rust's history, but in the
larger scheme of things, it's just a minor version increase.
- They let the Rust team declare "Here's what
we have achieved so far!"
- They also give new users a guidepost to
start getting into Rust.

----

### What are the editions?

- Rust 2015 - Current, initially released in 2015.
  - Lots of features we'll see today are actually available in 2015,
    but are marketed as part of 2018.
  - Theme was *stability*, because before 1.0 change was constant.
- Rust 2018 - Planned release in Dec 2018, as part of Rust 1.31.
  - Introduces new keywords and features, some of which aren't
    backward compatible with 2015.
  - Theme is *productivity*. We'll see why in this presentation.

**Note**: The actual Rust compiler binary you use isn't affected by
this. Edition is a configuration in the `Cargo.toml` file.

----

### Confused?

You opt-in to editions like below:

```rust
[package]
edition = "2018"
```

- But you still compile using whatever `rustc` that was installed with
 `rustup`. The flag above tells the toolchain what edition to use.
- As of now, very few features are 2018-only, but more are being
  stabilized.

---

## Revamped Module System

----

### Extern Crate Inconveniences

This was always required in Rust 2015.

In `Cargo.toml`,
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0.71"
serde_derive = "1.0.71"
```

And in `lib.rs`,
```rust
extern crate serde;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;
```

----

#### Different Interpretations of Similar-Looking Code

In Rust 2015,

```rust
// This works!
fn main() {
    let res: std::result::Result<i32> = std::result::Result::Ok(32)
}

mod submodule {
    fn method() {
        // This doesn't!
        let res: std::result::Result<i32> = std::result::Result::Ok(32)
    }
}
```

This is because in the path of `std::Result` is considered relative,
and the submodule doesn't contain any `std`.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Uniform Paths

In Rust 2018, we get uniform path naming:

- Use `crate` to refer to an item in our crate.
- Use `self` to refer to an item in our module.
- Use `super` to refer to an item in a parent module.
- Use crate name to refer to items in external crates.

----

Now you get code that makes sense all the time:

```rust
mod module1 {
    pub fn fun1() { }

    fn fun5( ) { self::fun1(); }

    mod module2 {
        fn fun2() { super::fun1(); }
    }
}

mod module3 {
    fn fun3() { crate::module1::fun1(); }

    fn fun4() -> std::option::Option<i32> { std::option::Option::Some(3) }
}
```

----

### Added Benefits

- Additional Visibility Modifiers
  - `pub(crate)` and `pub(in a::b::c)`
- Nested Imports
    ```rust
    use std::{
        fs::File,
        io::Read,
        path::{
            Path,
            PathBuf
        }
    };
    ```
